// Potential solutions to resolve the inconsistent Expo build failure:
// 1. Check for issues with dependencies:
//  - Run `expo prebuild --clean` to remove existing build artifacts.
//  - Ensure that all dependencies in your `package.json` are compatible with your Expo SDK version.
//  - Try updating or downgrading dependencies to resolve potential conflicts.
// 2. Clear the Expo cache:
//  - Run `expo start --clear` to reset the Expo development server and its cache.
// 3. Ensure proper project setup:
//  - Verify your project configuration in `app.json` or `expo.json`.
//  - Check your app's build configurations for any potential problems.
// 4. Check the Expo logs thoroughly for any subtle error messages:
//   - Examine the logs closely, even looking at seemingly insignificant lines of text.  The root cause may be implicit in details that seem unimportant.
// 5. If the problem is persistent, try creating a minimal reproducible example:
//   - Create a new project and gradually add components to isolate the problematic section of your codebase.
// 6. Consider upgrading/downgrading the Expo CLI and SDK versions:
//   - Sometimes issues may be tied to specific versions of Expo.  Consider rolling back or upgrading to a different version.
// 7. Check for issues in your project's files that may be causing problems:
//   - Make sure that your project's files adhere to naming conventions and don't contain any illegal characters or patterns.
