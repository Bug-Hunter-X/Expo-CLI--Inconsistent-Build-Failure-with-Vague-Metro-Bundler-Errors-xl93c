While building an Expo project, I encountered an unusual error related to the metro bundler. The error message was vague, offering no specific clues about the root cause. The build process would hang indefinitely, and neither the logs nor the Expo CLI provided any actionable error messages. This occurred inconsistently, sometimes building successfully and other times failing without any apparent pattern or changes to the codebase.
